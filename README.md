# elm-webgl-lessons

A series of lessons in elm-webgl.

[See them live](https://nacmartin.github.io/elm-webgl-lessons/)

I am writing this as I replicate the examples from [webgl lessons](http://learningwebgl.com/blog/?page_id=1217) to learn elm-webgl.

To run the examples:

````
cd lessons
elm-reactor
`````

And point your browser to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

Note that at the moment you will need [this fork](https://github.com/nacmartin/elm-webgl/tree/indexed-triangles) of elm-webgl, since I have added some features to the library, that have not been merged yet.
